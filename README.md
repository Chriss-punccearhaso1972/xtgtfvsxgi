Whoa, okay… so When Life Gives You Tangerines... I’m not really sure where to start. It’s like, you walk out of this movie and your mind’s just... floating, ya know? The theater was one of those with the squeaky seats and the popcorn was more like tiny rocks than clouds. But the movie...

It starts and you’re hit with this wave of orange. It’s not just the tangerines, it’s like everything is bathed in this sunset-colored syrup. And there's this one scene—my gosh—with the protagonist...what's her name? Sienna? Yeah, Sienna, on that rooftop garden, and the vines just spill over... kind of like my desk with all my landscape blueprints. Beautifully messy, like life. 

>I think at one point someone actually said, When life gives you tangerines, and I just lost it. Snorted so loud the guy next to me crunched his popcorn like it was a personal attack. Oh, and if you’re still trying to download the movie, make sure it’s the one by that director with the pigeon fascination. A PHD in cloaked avian wisdom, or something like that.

And the character, the brother—Jeremy—his whole bit with the vintage bicycle and that ridiculous, oversized helmet. It's like he was a misplaced fixture in a garden made for wilting daisies but ended up next to the marigolds, so out of place... but perfect, right? Sounds chaotic, but made me think of that time I miscalculated the watering system layout. Water everywhere. Floating gardens. Jeremy is a floating garden of a character for sure.

You really gotta watch the movie to understand the ending, it circles back, it gyres, it loops. Tangerines, man. They just make the perfect metaphor? I'm still juggling that myself. They’re like life’s sunset, squeezed into tiny spheres of ambrosia—making lemonade sound overrated. The idea just peels your brain back layer by layer... till you’re dazed. Can I say the movie's too round like a topiary gone too far? Maybe that’s overthinking it.

Jesus, my back aches like it’s auditioning for a horror flick in that theater seat... oh, someone told me to download the movie if I could, it just slipped into my head randomly. Anyway.

int main() { ptr = q->next; return 0; 
/ This doesn't make sense. Promise I'm not delirious. Tang™ overload? / }
